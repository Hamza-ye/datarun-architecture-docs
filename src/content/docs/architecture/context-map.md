> **Ground Truth:** The `datarunapi` codebase is the source of truth.

## Quick Reference
| Relationship | Relationship Type | Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Registry ──► Functional Domain** | OHS / Published Language | Event-Driven / Sync |
| **Scenario ──► Registry** | Downstream (Conformist) | Metadata Projection |
| **Policy ──► Registry** | ACL / Physics Engine | Transactional Rule Check |

## 1. Tactical Bounded Contexts (The Engine)

The system is partitioned into the following Pure Bounded Contexts:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Core Core"
        Engine["Projection Engine"]
    end

    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        Registry["Backbone Registry<br/>(Identities/Nodes)"]
        Scenario["Scenario Context<br/>(The Lens)"]
        Policy["Policy Context<br/>(The Physics)"]
    end

    Scenario -->|Animates| Registry
    Policy -->|Enforces| Registry
    Registry -->|Feeds| Engine
```

## 2. Strategic Strategic Relationships

| From | To | Pattern | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Registry** | **Functional Domain** | OHS + Published Language | Registry provides stable UIDs; Domains interpret meaning. |
| **Scenario** | **Engine** | Supplier → Customer | Scenario provides the "Reality Metadata" required for orchestration. |
| **Legacy Adapter** | **Registry** | Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) | Maps legacy tables (`team`, `org_unit`) to Registry UID backbone. |

## 3. Boundary Rules

1.  **Datarun never contains domain vocabulary.** (No "Stock", "Malaria").
2.  **Identities are globally unique.** 11-char UIDs are the only shared currency.
3.  **Projections are Contextual.** An Identity can have different roles in different Scenarios without changing the core Identity record.
