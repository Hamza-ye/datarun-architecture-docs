> **Status:** Active — Living Document
> **Scope:** Architecture Component Model (L2)
> **Ground Truth:** The `datarunapi` codebase is the source of truth for current state.

## Quick Reference
| Component | Responsibility | Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backbone** | Maintaining raw Registry Identities/Nodes. | Domain-Agnostic Store |
| **Projector** | Animating Backbone via Scenario Metadata. | Orchestration Engine |
| **Policies** | Enforcing "Physics" of Contextual Action. | Bounded Permission Model |
| **Adapter** | Bridging Legacy Sync Channels (V1/V2). | ACL / Anti-Corruption Layer |

## 1. Vision: The Contextual Projection Engine

Datarun is a **stateless orchestration engine** that projects business meaning onto a generic backbone. It does not "hold" business logic; it "executes" configuration.

### The Component Model (Level 1 Context)
```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Users/Identities
    subgraph "Identities (Users & Systems)"
        Human["Identity [UID]"]
    end

    %% The Platform
    subgraph "Datarun Platform (The Core)"
        Engine["PROJECTION ENGINE"]
        Backbone["GENERIC BACKBONE <br/>(Identities/Nodes)"]
        Projector["SCENARIO PROJECTOR <br/>(Metadata)"]
    end

    %% External Domains
    subgraph "Functional Domains"
        LMIS["LMIS (Accounting)"]
        Analytics["Reporting (DHIS2)"]
    end

    Human -- "Action Request" --> Engine
    Projector -- "Lens" --> Backbone
    Backbone -- "Contextual Data" --> Engine
    Engine -- "Events" --> LMIS
```

## 2. Core Architectural Abstractions

### A. The Backbone (Stable Universe)
A universe of raw **Identities** (People/Systems) and **Nodes** (Locations/Groups). They have zero business meaning. They are globally unique references (11-char UIDs).

### B. The Scenario (The Lens)
A metadata bundle that defines a "Reality." It maps UIDs to Roles (e.g., "Pharmacist") and Nodes to Meanings (e.g., "Supply Hub").

### C. Contextual Projection (The Binding)
The dynamic act of manifesting an Identity as a **Party** (e.g., "Supervisor") in a specific Scenario. This is the **Behavioral Layer** of the system.

## 3. What This System Is NOT

- **Not a domain-specific system.** Datarun never contains business logic for stock, medicine, or cases.
- **Not a hard-coded hierarchy.** Hierarchies are just "Relational Metadata" projected onto the Backbone.

## Appendix: Legacy Mappings (Adapter Layer)

To maintain operational continuity, the following legacy entities are currently mapped to the Backbone:

| Legacy Entity | Registry Mapping | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `team` | **Registry Party** | Temporary container for user groups. |
| `org_unit` | **Registry Node** | Static hierarchy representation. |
| `assignment` | **Policy Binding (Proxy)** | Links Template to Context. |
