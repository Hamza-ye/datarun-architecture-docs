# Exploratory Ideas Archive

> **Status:** Archived — these documents describe **unimplemented systems** and exploratory concepts.
> **Do NOT treat these as architectural constraints.** They are preserved as reference material for future design decisions.

## What's Here

These documents were created during exploratory architecture sessions for a planned downstream platform (LMIS, Python/FastAPI). They describe systems, patterns, and components that **do not exist in code**.

## AI Agent Instructions

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never load documents from `/_ideas/` unless explicitly instructed by the user.**
> These docs use present-tense, authoritative language that could be mistaken for descriptions of real systems. They are not. The only operational codebase is `datarunapi` (Java/Spring Boot).
